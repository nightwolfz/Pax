NodeJS + Koa + Socket.IO + Angular
=============================

A project to test the limits of a socket based approach to building interactive applications.

I will use this project to create a routing manager for websocket event handling.

Note that the project uses the --harmony flag on nodeJS to allow ECMAScript 6 syntax.

**EXPERIMENTAL. USE AT OWN RISK.**
